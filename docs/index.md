# Overview

This is a library and plugin to enhance [Grails] and [Gorm] to provide and expose an _opinionated_, ==well documented restful API== with intelligent out of the box defaults and minimal tweaking. It is easy to configure and customize on the fly at a client site without the need to recompile.

- **The simple stuff should be simple and automatic**
- DRY : Don't repeat yourself.
- Autogenerated code is evil. This includes tests
- Transpile where possible

Its somewhat opinionated but frames out Rest best practices.  in that it uses the [OpenAPI] spec (formerly [Swagger]) as well as how it maps the Gorm domains into that spec. Its accepts and returns only JSON and eschews XML

**Key features of this plugin include:**

- [ ] Near zero configuration to expose [Swagger] documented resources (the Gorm domains)
- [ ]  Rely on the domain's contraints as much as possible for configurations and docs.
- [ ]  Out of the box CRUD Controller modified from Grails [@Resource annotation and RestfulController](http://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/REST.html#domainResources) that can delegate to transactional DAO/repo falvored services based on naming convention or configuration. Uses the [DAO] plugin.
- [ ]  Custom schema selects for retruned JSON fields that can be confiugured at runtime by a customer (does not require recompiling views)
- [ ]  Consistent documented use of HTTP status codes and headers
- [ ]  Used [cache-headers](https://github.com/grails-plugins/cache-headers)
- [ ]  Ability to 'query by POST' (to allow query criteria to be provided within the request body)
- [ ]  Intelligent defaults for security plugin with OATH and JWT.
- [ ]  Tools to ease GEB functional tests with Spock
- [ ]  Extensive regression tests
